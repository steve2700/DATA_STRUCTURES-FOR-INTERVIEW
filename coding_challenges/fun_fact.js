// using let you cannot redeclare variables but with var you can
// if you output there is error

//let x = 20;
//let x = 30;

var x = 20;
var x = 30;// with var you can declare variables
// fun facts
let x = 20;
let y = 30;

// lets talk about hoisting 
// it means you are using the variable before it declared
carName = "volvo";
var carName;  // this is ok


// understanding constant

const stew = 2222;
stew = 2225; // this will give the error beacause you can not reassign variables
// use const whenever you know you are not changing  values
